# Setup Wifi

Enter your details in the `/boot/auto-run/current_wifi.config` file and then change the name exactly to `/boot/auto-run/wifi.config` and reboot the pi.

The `/boot/auto-run/startup.sh` script will then update the wifi settings on the next boot.

Go to <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md> if there are any errors.
